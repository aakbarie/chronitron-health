This project is towards building an artificial intilligent application to help dialysis patients. This app will track the daily values of patients, allow them to track their daily values with visualizations, and contact their dialysis centers in case of incongruities. Further, the application allows constant access to patients doctors and nurses, with the ability to download the patients data in a csv format.

Current Status
--------------

Currently, the app works only as a form for patients to enter and track their values. It also allows visualization and the downloading of the data. For the next iteration, I am building in security features to lock down the application to signed patients, doctors, and nurses.

The app is currently hosted on shinyapps.io at [this] (https://akbaresfahani.shinyapps.io/ccpdFlowsheet/) location.
